# Image to Sketch Synthesis

## Introduction

The Image to Sketch Synthesis project explores three different methodologies - K-Means clustering, Autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - for transforming images into sketches. The project aims to advance sketch synthesis technology and explore new possibilities for applications across various fields, including criminal investigations, digital entertainment, and artistic creation.

### Autoencoders

To use the Autoencoders method:

1. Prepare the CUHK Face Sketch Database.
2. Execute the script `Autoencoders.py`.
3. Review the generated sketches in the output directory.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

To use the GANs method:

1. Prepare the training dataset.
2. Use the trained model to generate sketches with `GAN.py`.
3. Review the generated sketches in the output directory.
