# Image to Sketch Synthesis

## Introduction

The Image to Sketch Synthesis project explores three different methodologies - K-Means clustering, Autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - for transforming images into sketches. The project aims to advance sketch synthesis technology and explore new possibilities for applications across various fields, including criminal investigations, digital entertainment, and artistic creation.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-to-sketch-synthesis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd image-to-sketch-synthesis`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### K-Means Clustering

To use the K-Means clustering method:

1. Ensure the required dataset is available.
2. Run the script `K-Means.py`.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to generate sketches from images.

### Autoencoders

To use the Autoencoders method:

1. Prepare the CUHK Face Sketch Database.
2. Execute the script `Autoencoders.py`.
3. Review the generated sketches in the output directory.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

To use the GANs method:

1. Prepare the training dataset.
2. Use the trained model to generate sketches with `GAN.py`.
3. Review the generated sketches in the output directory.
